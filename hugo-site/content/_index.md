<p class="mb-6">I am Priyam, an aspiring actuarial model developer. This is my personal homepage.</p>

<p class="mb-6">I stumbled upon trading and capital markets at 17, which sparked my passion for understanding finance. For a brief period, I was in academia—studying Statistics (Honors) at the University of Calcutta, Kolkata under <a href="https://rkmrc-cs.zohosites.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">RKMRC, Narendrapur</a>.</p>

<p class="mb-6">So during this time, I was diving deep into financial markets and playing around with data-driven stuff. That curiosity eventually led me to actuarial science—and man, the gap between what you learn in theory and what actually happens in the industry was a real eye-opener.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Once I saw that, I knew I had to focus on building real, practical skills. I started focusing in on areas that actually matter in the field, and it just clicked with what I'm passionate about. That's how I ended up setting my sights on becoming an expert in actuarial model development, especially in general insurance.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Right now, I'm all about getting sharper with pricing, reserving, and pushing for innovation in the insurance world. Still learning, still growing. If you're curious, feel free to check out some of the <a href="/project" class="link-style">projects</a> and <a href="/blog" class="link-style">ideas</a> I've been working on.</p>

<p class="mb-6">Outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar/ukulele, singing, and staying active—whether it's working out, running, cycling, or playing tennis, basketball. I cherish time with my family and my brother from another mother. Music, in all its forms, is a constant source of joy and inspiration.</p>
