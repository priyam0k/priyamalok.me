                <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-8 !-mt-2">Published on July 31, 2025</p>

                <p>As my mentorship programme with Portagion recently concluded in July with a fireside chat, I found myself reflecting on the most impactful moments. A conversation from our March session particularly stood out - one I had with a personal hero in the actuarial world, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-jordan-a2a56689" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">Michael Jordan</a>, better known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MJtheFellowActuary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">MJ The Fellow Actuary</a>. I had the chance to ask him about the future of blockchain in insurance from an actuarial standpoint.</p>
                
                <p>His response was insightful. From a technical perspective, he pointed towards the complex challenge of modeling NFT price fluctuations. But on a practical note for an aspiring actuary, his advice was clear: prioritize the qualification examinations and perhaps put the world of blockchain on a brief pause.</p>

                <p>That advice to focus on the core curriculum resonated deeply and remains a firm priority. However, my curiosity about what feels like an inevitable technological shift in our industry persisted. I believe that to be a forward-thinking professional, one must balance foundational knowledge with an awareness of emerging frontiers. This post is the result of that balancing actâ€”my own detailed exploration into the past, present, and future of blockchain in insurance, spurred by that memorable conversation. ðŸ˜¬</p>
            
                <h2>The Old Guard's Dilemma: An Industry Built on Friction</h2>
                <p>The traditional insurance industry, while a vital pillar of the global economy, operates on a model burdened by deep-seated structural flaws. Heavy reliance on manual, paper-based processes and outdated legacy systemsâ€”some still running on technology from the 1980sâ€”creates significant economic costs, operational risks, and a persistent trust deficit with customers. The industry's very foundation is a promise, yet the processes supporting it are often characterized by opacity and friction.</p>
                <p>This environment is plagued by a lack of a single, verifiable source of truth, making it highly susceptible to fraud. The <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/insurance-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">FBI</a> estimates that non-health insurance fraud costs the average U.S. family between $400 and $700 per year in increased premiums. This created a clear and compelling need for a new architectureâ€”one that could engender trust not through a central authority, but through the very nature of the system itself.</p>

                <h2>Enter Blockchain: A New Architecture for Trust</h2>
                <p>The technological answer emerged with the advent of blockchain and, more importantly for insurance, the "smart contracts" it enables. These are not contracts in the legal sense, but self-executing computer programs where the terms of an agreement are written directly into code. This technological leap was the critical catalyst that made blockchain relevant to the contract-centric insurance industry.</p>
                
                <h3>Core Applications Across the Value Chain</h3>
                <p>After years of experimentation, a number of mature applications are now delivering tangible value:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Claims Management & Fraud Prevention:</strong> This remains the "killer app." A prime example is the platform used by <a href="https://www.statefarm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">StateFarm</a> and <a href="https://www.usaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">USAA</a> to automate auto subrogation claims. By using a shared ledger, they streamline the exchange of information and funds, reducing processing time and administrative overhead.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parametric Insurance:</strong> This model has emerged as a powerful application. The <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">Lemonade Foundation</a> launched a blockchain-based crop insurance product for farmers in Africa. It uses smart contracts automatically triggered by verifiable weather data from trusted sources, making microinsurance economically viable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulatory Reporting:</strong> The <a href="https://www.aaisonline.com/what-we-do/openidl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">openIDL</a> platform provides a secure and efficient way for U.S. insurers to submit regulatory data, reducing a significant administrative burden.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Reality Check: Headwinds and Hard Lessons</h2>
                <p>The path to adoption is not straightforward. The industry has faced significant hurdles and high-profile failures that offer crucial lessons.</p>
                
                <div class="callout">
                    <h3>Case Study in Failure: The Fall of B3i</h3>
                    <p class="text-base">The <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2022/07/29/677926.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">insolvency of B3i</a> in 2022 is a critical cautionary tale. Backed by giants like <a href="https://www.swissre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">Swiss Re</a> and <a href="https://www.allianz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">Allianz</a>, the consortium aimed to build a unified platform for the reinsurance market. It failed not because the technology was flawed, but due to a confluence of fundamental business and strategic challenges, including insufficient market demand and flawed governance.</p>
                    <p class="text-base"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Industry-wide standards are more likely to emerge from solutions that first deliver undeniable, bottom-up value, rather than being designed by a top-down committee.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Systemic Barriers to Adoption</h3>
                <p>Beyond specific failures, the industry faces persistent headwinds:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regulatory & Legal:</strong> Ambiguity around the legal status of smart contracts and conflicts with data privacy laws like GDPR create significant risk and uncertainty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical & Operational:</strong> The immense cost and complexity of integrating with legacy systems, coupled with a lack of industry-wide standards and interoperability, remain the greatest practical barriers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human & Cultural:</strong> A conservative, risk-averse culture, corporate inertia, and a significant shortage of talent with both insurance and blockchain expertise slow down innovation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Economic Equation and the Next Frontier</h2>
                <p>Despite the challenges, the economic case is compelling. An early analysis by <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">Goldman Sachs</a> projected that blockchain could generate $2 to $4 billion in annual cost savings in the U.S. underwriting sector alone. Market forecasts project a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) exceeding 50% through 2031.</p>
                <p>The true long-term potential, however, lies in its convergence with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). This technological triumvirate enables a profound shift from a reactive model of loss compensation to a proactive model of risk prevention. An insurer's value proposition moves from "we will pay you back if something bad happens" to "we will help you stop the bad thing from happening in the first place."</p>
                
                <div class="callout">
                    <h3>Insuring the Digital World: The NFT Challenge</h3>
                    <p class="text-base">As MJ alluded to, insuring digital-native assets like Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is a complex new frontier. It presents unique challenges in valuing intangible and highly volatile assets, underwriting code, and assessing novel cyber risks. The famous case of Jack Dorsey's first tweet, purchased as an NFT for $2.9 million and later receiving a top bid of only $6,800, starkly illustrates the valuation problem. Companies like <a href="https://evertas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-style">Evertas</a> are pioneering this space, developing the underwriting frameworks that will be essential for the growing digital economy.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>The initial hype of wholesale disruption has given way to a more nuanced and sustainable evolution. The market has undergone a "great filter," shifting from ambitious, capital-intensive projects toward disciplined solutions delivering measurable, near-term ROI. While the path to widespread adoption is still paved with the significant challenges I've outlined, the trajectory is clear. Blockchain is evolving from a buzzword into a foundational technology that will bring much-needed trust and efficiency to the insurance industry. The journey is just beginning.</p>
                <p class="italic">While my immediate path is dedicated to my qualification examinations, this analysis is a step in my ongoing commitment to understanding the technologies that will shape the future of P&C insurance. I look forward to continuing the exploration.</p>
